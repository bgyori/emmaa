EMMAA Model Queries
===================

Submitting a Query
------------------

The model queries page can answer direct queries about the model. A query
consists of a statement type, a subject and an object. Together with the
query, at least one model needs to be selected for the query submission to be
valid. A query can also optionally be submitted for registration. With this
option, when returning to the page, previous queries will be loaded with
their latest result.

  cancer model.*

If the query is badly formatted or missing information, an error will be
shown stating the type of error.

The query will be received by the query service and return a
response which shows if the query was applicable to the model or not. The
typical response time can be up to a minute, so please be patient when
posting queries. There is an initial start-up time for a query to be
processed, making it more efficient to query multiple models at the same time.
