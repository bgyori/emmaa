EMMAA Model Queries
===================

The detailed test results page shows a test result at a high detail for a
specific model and model type. The left column describes the path found that
satisfies the test. The right column contains a detailed description of each
edge in the path with a list of english representation of the statements
supporting the edge.

Results for Different Model Types
---------------------------------

The navigation bar contains a drop down menu where another model type can be
selected. After selecting the model type to switch to, click on "Load Type"
to load the same test on the model with the selected model type. *Note that
only model types available for the specific model are available in the menu.*
