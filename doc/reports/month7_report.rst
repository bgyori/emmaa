ASKE Month 7 Milestone Report
=============================

Use cases for the EMMAA system (and ASKE systems in general)
------------------------------------------------------------

Push Science
~~~~~~~~~~~~
In 2015, Paul Cohen defined "push scholarship" as: "[...]  instead of
pulling results into our heads, we push results into machine-maintained big
mechanisms, where they can be examined by anyone. This could change science
profoundly."

ASKE systems have the potential to go beyond this ambitious goal by
- actively searching for new discoveries and data,
- autonomously updating a set of models by integrating new discoveries,
- designing model analysis experiments to understand the effect of this new
  knowledge
- reporting the effect of new discoveries on scientific questions
  relevant to the user

In other words, novel, relevant implications of discoveries, as soon as they
appear, are "pushed" to scientists.

Monitoring reproducibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
About 3,600 new publications appear each day on PubMed, in biomedicine alone.
Using automated model extension and analysis, ASKE systems can evaluate newly
reported mechanisms against experimental observations (data) and vice versa.
Reported mechanisms that aren't supported by prior observations, as well as
observations that don't make sense with respect to existing models can be
detected. This technology can help address some aspects of the reproducibility
crisis in a principled way.

Automated scientific discovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is a large body of unexplained observations (i.e., open scientific
questions for which no underlying mechanistic explanation is known) appearing
in the biomedical literature and in data stores An ASKE system that immediately
aggregates and models new knowledge and evaluates its implications with respect
to unexplained observations, is likely to be the first to notice that a
previously unexplained observation can now be explained.  Novel candidate
explanations to observations constructed automatically using ASKE systems can
be experimentally confirmed and published.
