ASKE Month 6 Milestone Report
=============================

Making model analysis and model content fully auditable
-------------------------------------------------------

When browsing the results of model tests, it is often of interest to inspect
the specific provenance of each modeled mechanisms that contributed to the
result. EMMAA models are built automatically from primary knowledge
sources (databases and literature), and model components are annotated such
that given the result, we can link back to the original sources.

Links to browse evidence are available in all of the following contexts:

- New statements added to the model
- Most supported statements in the model
- New tests applicable to the model
- Passed/failed tests and the mechanisms constituting paths by which tests
  passed
- Query results
