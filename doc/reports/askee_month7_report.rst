ASKE-E Month 7 Milestone Report
===============================

Demonstrations at the stakeholder meeting
-----------------------------------------

Natural language dialogue interaction with EMMAA models
-------------------------------------------------------

Automatically generated text annotations in context
---------------------------------------------------
As an extension of paper centered view of model statements reported last month
we integrated EMMAA with hypothes.is service that allows annotating webpages.
The figure below illustrates the part of the updated "Paper" tab on 
EMMAA dashboard.

For each paper that has extracted statements a small hypothesis ("h.") badge is
displayed. Clicking on this badge starts the process of uploading the annotations
for statements extracted from this paper. After all annotations are added, an
external page with this paper opens up in a new tab. In addition, a link to this
page is displayed on EMMAA website.

Viewing the uploaded annotations requires installing Google Chrome hypothes.is
extension. The figure below shows how annotations can be further viewed and
curated on a new opened page. In this example, a paper on PubMed Central is
annotated. The sentences supporting each of the extracted statements are 
highlighted in the paper and the statements can be viewed in the annotations
panel on the right. For instance, this image shows the highlighted sentence
mentioning "FGF1â€“heparin complex" and the extracted "heparin binds FGF1" INDRA
statement.

Developing the EMMAA REST API for flexible integration
------------------------------------------------------
We continued working on extending EMMAA REST API for the integration with other
teams. One of the key goals was to allow dynamic retrieval of EMMAA models and 
tests metadata. To enable that we implemented four new endpoints in EMMAA REST 
API that support the retrieval of the following data:
- A list of all available EMMAA models;
- Model metadata (short name, human readable name, description, links to NDEx
browsing interface and to model's Twitter account) for a given model;
- A list of test corpora a given model is tested against;
- Test corpus metadata (name and description) for a given test corpus.

Another extension of EMMAA API we implemented is the support for running
queries programmatically. Previously it was only possible to submit the queries
through a form on the Query page of EMMAA dashboard and browse the displayed 
results. The new approach allows our collaborators send programmatic requests 
to the API and receive the results in JSON format. Similarly to the interactive 
interface on the dashboard, the programmatic endpoint supports three types of 
queries: static (find a path between two entities), open search (find upstream 
regulators or downstream targets of an entity), and dynamic (estimate dynamical 
model properties by simulating the model) queries.
